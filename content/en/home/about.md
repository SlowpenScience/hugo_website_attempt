**We are a group of researchers who gathered to discuss about ways to practice and promote a slow, open, and sustainable science.**

Although most of us work in academic institutions, the Walden III Slowpen Science Laboratory is not affiliated to any university or to any other public/private research organism.
Currently, we do not have any physical lab space but our official geographical location is at Nort-sur-Erdre, close to Nantes, France.
