##### Slow Science
By slow we refer to an approach where the rate of work is not dictated by productivist imperatives. We want to take time to understand what we do, how we do it, and why we do it.
##### Open Science
By open we refer to research practices that enable to gain scientific knowledge in a transparent and accessible way.
##### Slow × Open = Sustainable Science
By sustainable we refer to a scientific method which does not jeopardise its own preservation nor the preservation of its ecosystem. We want a science for and based on equity. We stand for diversity, prosociality, and against dominations (sexism, racism, social classes, etc…). We believe that a robust science can foster and be fostered by a sustainable society.
